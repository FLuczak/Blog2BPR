                A game I developed while working for Games Incubator. The game was created in unity and C#. My main responsibilities were: maintaining existing gameplay/AI features, as well as creating tools that allowed other people from the team to work more efficiently on level design and adding content to the game.

                A game I developed while working for Games Incubator. The game was created in unity and C#. My main responsibilities were mainly working on AI functionalities, as well as maintaining gameplay features of the game. After the release I was responsible for live-ops of the game, mainly fixing reported bugs, as well as working on additional content and features post-release.

                A team project I got to work on during 1st year of my studies. Smash Balls is a fun 2-4 player couch versus game with unique controls. In this project I took on the role of an Unreal Engine programmer, I worked on 3Cs implementations with emphasis on player states and their controls as well as player interactions.

                This engine was created for a project at Breda University Of Applied Sciences,it was created to facilitate development of RTS games. The tools I was responsible for were: AI editor for Finite State Machines and Behavior Trees, Animation Controllers, as well as grid-based navigation. I was also responsible for the CI/CD and QA pipelines of the project using github actions.

                A passion project created in my free time. The engine is quite universal, yet its main benchmark and target game genre is bullet hell, top-down roguelikes. For this project I created: Navmesh navigation, AI structures with visual editor, performant physics system, Entity and Component Serialization, Asset explorer.
